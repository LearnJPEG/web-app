<h2><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h2>
NFT trading activity has more than doubled between July and August 2021, according to the number of unique wallets that either bought or sold an NFT. By August 2021, there were roughly 280,000 unique buyers or sellers (the source does not distinguish between the two - after a growth of 185,000 unique wallets).
The current adaptation rate for NFTs has been quite good but not the best. We have seen a lot of Celebrities & Influencers purchasing NFTs, which in turn bought in a lot of new users. But a majority of these New Users never convert to buying & selling.
The major problem faced by these New Users are education & onboarding. There is no dedicated platform for NFT Education available currently. Onboarding into NFTs is already a very tough task for a lot of people due to the complexity of handling their own wallets without complete knowledge. A lot of users also fall victims to scams due to this lack of information.
How do we plan on fixing this?â€¨Enter LearnJPEG. We have designed a NFT Education platform with a lot of added utilities + benefits for learners. The main function of our platform will be:
Learn & Earn - This will allow new users to enrol into NFT + Web3 courses and earn in-app coins for successfully completing the course. These courses will contain a variety of content, such as text guides, videos, podcasts & more. The course will be followed by some questions which would authenticate wether a user really learnt. On successful completion of the course, the user would receive a fixed no. of coins. These coins can be converted into NFTs, merch or other goodies using our Rewards Store. All courses on our platform will be free of cost and we promise to never display any ads.

<h2><u>MISSION</u></h2>
Our team is committed to the future of blockchain technology and is enamoured by the utility of smart contracts. As the world transitions to Web3 and becomes increasingly interconnected, there is boundless potential for Decentralised Autonomous Organisations to act as transparent and self-sustainable organisations capable of functioning without human interaction for a community.</br>
Our roadmap is very collaborative and will further be proposed & voted on by our Members Pass holders. With imaginative ideas, adequate resources and coordination, we believe we can bring Raffles to the Metaverse!</br>
