<h2><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h2>
NFT trading activity has more than doubled between July and August 2021, according to the number of unique wallets that either bought or sold an NFT. By August 2021, there were roughly 280,000 unique buyers or sellers (the source does not distinguish between the two - after a growth of 185,000 unique wallets).

The current adaptation rate for NFTs has been quite good but not the best. We have seen a lot of Celebrities & Influencers purchasing NFTs, which in turn bought in a lot of new users. But a majority of these New Users never convert to buying & selling.

The major problem faced by these New Users are education & onboarding. There is no dedicated platform for NFT Education available currently. Onboarding into NFTs is already a very tough task for a lot of people due to the complexity of handling their own wallets without complete knowledge. A lot of users also fall victims to scams due to this lack of information.

How do we plan on fixing this?
Enter LearnJPEG. We have designed a NFT Education platform with a lot of added utilities + benefits for learners. The main function of our platform will be:
</br>
</br><b>• Learn & Earn -</b> This will allow new users to enrol into NFT + Web3 courses and earn in-app coins for successfully completing the course. These courses will contain a variety of content, such as text guides, videos, podcasts & more. The course will be followed by some questions which would authenticate wether a user really learnt. On successful completion of the course, the user would receive a fixed no. of coins. These coins can be converted into NFTs, merch or other goodies using our Rewards Store. All courses on our platform will be free of cost and we promise to never display any ads.
</br>
</br>
<h2><u>MISSION</u></h2>
We as a company believe in providing NFT education to the masses and that is the reason behind all our corses being free of cost. Our mission is to onboard & educate 1,000,000+ New NFT users in the next few years through our platform & our resources. 
</br>
</br>
<h2><u>TEAM</u></h2>
The platform was the proposed & designed by Shubham Kumar (Twitter - @0xshub). The platform development was/is outsourced to 2 web development firms which were located in India and UK. The content on our website will/is be published by our employees & contributors and they are/will be compensated from our platform revenue. </br>
</br>
<h2><u>REVENUE MODEL</u></h2>
LearnJPEG will bring in revenue from the multiple sources, but our main source of revenue would be from Project listings under Mint Here. This will be the revenue source which we will start our initial revenue discovery with, Other revenue models will be bought in & tested at later phases.

</br><b>• Mint Here -</b> We provide an option for project listings under Mint Here on our website and projects can apply for this directly on our website. These applications are screened by our team and only handpicked & curated projects will be listed. This would allow a project to allow our users to mint directly from their contract. This will attract a listing fees for the project. We will also provide dedicated support during the mint period of a project and will provide analytical data to provide a better insight on the minters. We will be limiting our focus towards profit by limiting the Mint Here listings to only 10 a month.
